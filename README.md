Does that occur to you that sometimes you spotted a party nearby and want to get hyped together, but you don't know how to join? Do you want to reach out new people and attend the best local meetings/parties? These questions inspired our team to develop this IOS app that aims to help users host, request and attend parties.

To make this app, we split the task into front-end(Objective-C) and back-end (Java), and linked the whole app together with AWS and restful-web-service.
